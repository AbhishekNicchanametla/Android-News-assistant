# Android-News-assistant
This repository contains all the files related to android app news assistant. This project is made as a part of internship at Samsung Research Institute. Contact me for apk and codes.

The main purpose of the project is making people to get updated with news that is happening around them and also helping blind people to read news. It aims to construct a android application that changes the way news is being accessed now. The project aims to target two sections of people, the people who are in crowded places and blind people. Rather than following the traditional way of reading newspapers to get knowledge user can hear news just like songs which is very comfortable even in crowded places. Moreover project aims at helping users to improve their vocabulary by providing the meaning of a word they see in news article with a simple click on word. App also talks with the blind people to get their preferences and provide news in speech format basis on their  interest.
